#### Interactive visualizations project on 24 years of US wildfire data

Uncontrolled blazes spurred by weather, wind, and dry underbrush, wildfires can burn millions of acres of land at rapid speeds and can consume everything—trees, homes, even humans—in their paths. In our project we decided to analyze wildfire that occured from 1992 to 2015. In order to show better picture we have created two visualizations: the dashboard and the map.

Dashboard shows the number of fires that happened each year, it also provided user ability to see the number of fires by cause of the fire. D3 is used to make the dashboard interactive. Interactive map illustrates the occurance of the fire by location, time and fire size. Kepler.gl map is used.
